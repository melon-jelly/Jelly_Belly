This is a project of generating a word cloud image for the reviews of Disney's new movie, Cruella.

- In cruella_review_collecting.py, I scrapped 50 pages of movie reviews from Korean movie review site, NAVER movie.
- In creulla_wordCloud.py, I generated word cloud and shaped it as same as cruella character's shape.

If you are practicing python word cloud, this is a good one.

Anything about word cloud grammer, below is the library:
